# subset-sum-pisinger
Implements Pisinger's 2004 algorithm that provides a linear time, iterative solution to subset sum when input is only positive integers and the target sum is a positive constant C that is greater than or equal to each integer in the set.

### Formal Algorithm Description
Given a set ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N=\{1,...,%20n\}) of n items with positive integer weights w1,..., w n and a capacity c, the subset sum problem (SSP) is to find a subset of N such that the corresponding total weight is maximized without exceeding the capacity c. Recall the formal definition as introduced in Section 1.2:
